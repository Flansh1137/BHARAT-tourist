              Misal Pav is quintessentially from Pune and is one of the most popular Maharashtrian breakfast, snack or
              even brunch. It is a street food popularly found in Mumbai. It has a spicy and tangy lentil curry which is
              made with moth beans and is served with Pav bread. At times, it is eaten with yoghurt to lessen the spice.

              Momos, who doesn't love momos? Sikkim and Momos are complementary to one another. Sikkim is the place that
              is going to serve you the best momos you'll ever taste in your life. Believed to be of Tibetan origin and
              modulated by the Nepalese cuisine the momos are the lifeline of Sikkim. Momo is a small package of steamed
              bun with some fillings. Momo typically consists of two parts - the cover and the filling. The cover is
              made of dough made of white flour and water. Sometimes yeast or baking soda is also added to the dough to
              enhance the texture of the momos. Originally these momos were made with ground meat fillings, but over the
              years a lot of modifications have been made that have made dumplings even better.
