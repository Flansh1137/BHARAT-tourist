        History of India</h3>

    <div class="" style=" padding: 30px 200px ; font-size: 20px;">
        India’s history can be broken down into three major phases. The first phase is the ancient period known as
        Ancient India, which covers thousands of years that began when humans first settled in India. This period
        includes the Indus Valley Civilization (c. 3300-1300 BCE), which is considered one of the world’s oldest
        civilizations and a precursor to modern Indian culture.
        <br>
        <br>
        In medieval India, a period in Indian history is seen as lasting from the ancient period to the Mughal Empire.
        This long span of time begins in the 6th century AD and ends in 1526 when the empire was established. Some
        historians believe that it started later than these dates and ended earlier.

        <br>
        <br>
        In the early 20th century, India was also experiencing a period of change. In 1857, the Indian independence
        movement began in Bengal with the first nationalistic revolutionary movement. The British Empire controlled
        India at this time and it lasted until 1947 when India gained its independence.

        Culture of India</h3>

    <div class="" style=" padding: 30px 200px ; font-size: 20px;">
        India has a rich cultural heritage, reflected in its diverse population. The country’s culture has been shaped
        by various external and internal influences. Over the centuries, India has seen a significant fusion of Hindus,
        Muslims, Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists. These religions are collectively known as Indian religions as they
        originated in India.
        <br>
        <br>
        “Unity in diversity” – these are words that do not just hold meaning but can be applied to a country like India.
        From the time of Mauryas, Cholas and Mughals to the period of the British Empire, India has always been famous
        for its traditions and hospitality.
        <br>
        <br>

        India was once one of the richest countries in the world before being invaded by the British in the early 17th
        century. It is also one of the first places in the world where diamonds were found.

        Sanskrit is a very old language that belongs to the Indo-European family of languages, from which most modern
        European languages originate.
        Saint Gyandev is credited with creating Snakes and Ladders in the 13th century. The ladders in the game

        but its original meaning remains unchanged.
        <br>
        <br>
        Chess is a two-player strategy board game that was invented in India. It was originally called “Chaturanga”,

        and has inspired many variations, including Blitz chess.
        Brahmagupta was the first to develop the concept of zero, while Aryabhata developed the place value system. In
        the sixth century, Brahmagupta wrote a book called Brahmasphutasiddhanta, which described zero and how it could
        be used as a number in mathematical equations. Aryabhata developed the place value system, which is still used
        in modern-day mathematics.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the sixth century, Budhayana was the first person to calculate the value of pi. He did this well before any

        Sun long before Western astronomers.
        Ayurveda, which is the earliest school of medicine in the world, was born in India thousands of years ago. In
        fact, it is said that Ayurveda was created by Lord Brahma himself.
